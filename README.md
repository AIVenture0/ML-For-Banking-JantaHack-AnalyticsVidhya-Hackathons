## Introduction

- Have you ever wondered how lenders use various factors such as credit score, annual income, the loan amount approved, tenure, debt-to-income ratio etc. and select your __interest rates__? 

- The process, defined as ‘__risk-based pricing__’, uses a sophisticated algorithm that leverages different determining factors of a loan applicant. 

Selection of significant factors will help develop a prediction algorithm which can estimate __loan interest rates__ based on --
- clients
- information

On one hand, knowing the factors will help consumers and borrowers to increase their credit worthiness and place themselves in a better position to negotiate for getting a lower interest rate. On the other hand, this will help lending companies to get an immediate fixed interest rate estimation based on clients information. Here, your goal is to use a training dataset to <font color='blue'>__predict the loan rate category (1 / 2 / 3)__</font> that will be assigned to each loan in our test set.

You can use any combination of the features in the dataset to make your loan rate category predictions. Some features will be easier to use than others.

## Evaluation Metric

The evaluation metric for this competition is __Weighted F1 Score__.
